# Project Collaboration Platform

## Problem Statement

Students often struggle to find meaningful project collaboration opportunities that allow them to apply their skills, work with peers, and gain verifiable real-world experience. Existing platforms either focus on code hosting or professional networking, but lack structured collaboration and transparent contribution tracking. This project aims to provide a dedicated platform where students can collaborate on projects, receive mentorship, and build credible experience through structured workflows.
